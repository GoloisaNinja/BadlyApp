                Badly Web App created by GoloisaNinja in association with Grenade Flavored Water and FacePunchDynamite. This App
                is entirely a work of fun and should never be used in any serious matter or to start a business.  That would just 
                be so dumb.  Thanks as always to Marc and Jarrett for their tireless work in the fields of innovation and ridiculousness.
